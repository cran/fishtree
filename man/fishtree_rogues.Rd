\title{Get rogue taxa that break the monophyly of defined taxa}
\usage{
fishtree_rogues(rank)
}
\arguments{
\item{rank}{the (possibly paraphyletic) rank for which rogue or intruder species should be identified.}
}
\value{
A vector of species names, potentially empty.
}
\description{
For groups that were recovered as paraphyletic in the phylogenetic analysis,
uses the Fish Tree of Life API to identify which species prevented that clade
from being recovered as monophyletic.

\examples{
\dontrun{
fishtree_rogues("Gobiidae")   # several rogue taxa!
fishtree_rogues("Labridae")   # nice and monophlyetic
